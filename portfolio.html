                    Hey y'all! My name is Tsarina Islam. I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. Growing up, I always had a passion for music. I was in choir since fourth grade, continuing into high school when I also joined marching band and jazz band. My sophomore year of high school, I decided I wanted to pursue music as a career. Through a lot of hard work, I got into Westminster Choir College in Princeton, NJ on academic scholarship to earn my Bachelor of Arts in Music. I was given the opportunity to perform with many world-renown ensembles such as the Berlin Philharmonic, the New York Philharmonic, the Spoleto Festival Orchestra, and the Philadelphia Orchestra.`I currently teach music to PK3 through 8th grade at a school in West Philadelphia.
